            <h2>Instructions</h2> 
            <ol>
                <li>Make a marinade by mixing the listed ingredients. Completely cover the lamb chops and refrigerate for 1 to 12 
                    hours in a glass container with a lid or sealed plastic bag.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 F. Scrape off the marinade from the lamb chops and discard. Pat them dry.</li>
                <li>Over medium-high heat heat an oven-safe heavy bottomed skillet and add 1 tbsp olive oil. Season the chops
                    with salt and pepper and sear them for 1.5 minutes per side.</li>
                <li>Transfer to the oven and cook until the internal temperature reaches 135 F for medium (about 8 minutes), 
                    or 125 F for medium-rare (about 6 minutes).</li>
                <li>Take out the chops from the oven, transfer to a plate, cover with foil and let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the chops are resting you can prepare the Dijon Mustard Dill Sauce. In the same skillet where you cooked
                     the chops over medium heat add the cream, mustard and honey. Stir to mix and simmer for 5 minutes. 
                     Remove from heat, add the dill, stir and transfer to a serving dish. Alternatively add the rested lamb chops 
                     to the sauce in the skillet and serve family style.</li>
