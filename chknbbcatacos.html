            <h4>What is Barbacoa Chicken?</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s a lighter take on the classic dish made by steam-roasting a whole chicken in a smoky homemade adobo 
            sauce with onions and a handful of dried bay leaves.

            <h2>Instructions</h2> 
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 250ºF (121ºC) with rack set in lowest position. Heat oil in a large (7- or 8-quart) Dutch 
                    oven over medium heat. Pat chicken dry then season all over with salt, about 2 teaspoons total, rubbing 
                    some directly on breast meat underneath skin.</li>
                <li>Carefully add chicken, breast side down, to pot with hot oil. Add onions and bay leaves, nestling them 
                    around chicken. Cook chicken until breast is deep golden brown, 5–6 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken 
                    breast side up and brown until bottom side is deep golden brown, 5–6 minutes. </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, add ⅓ cup adobo sauce to 1 ¾ cups water, stir until combined; pour over chicken. Brush remaining
                    tablespoon adobo sauce over breast and legs of chicken. Bring liquid in pot to a simmer then cover with lid
                    and transfer to oven. </li>
                <li>Roast chicken until meat can easily be pulled from bone and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the 
                    breast register 165ºF (74ºC) and legs register 172ºF (78ºC), 1½–1¾ hours.</li>
                <li>Using tongs, carefully transfer chicken to a cutting board (it may fall apart—that’s OK). Skim off and discard
                    any grease from surface of broth. Simmer broth over medium-high heat until reduced and thickened, 20 minutes. 
                    Season sauce to taste with salt (I start with ½ teaspoon).</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, remove and discard chicken skin. Remove meat from bones and shred into small pieces; add back to pot
                    with reduced sauce and toss to combine.</li>
                <li>
                    Served shredded chicken with lime wedges (a squeeze of fresh lime juice adds a lot here) tortillas and desired toppings.
                </li>                       
            </ol>
